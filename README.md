Hello, world!

I'm Veronica, an Industrial Engineering undergrad at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I'll be graduating here in December of 2017.

Prior to Hong Kong, I was living in Ho Chi Minh City, Hong Kong (for ths first time), Beijing and Seoul - in order of recency.

I want to work as a consultant or analyst at the cross-section of technology, intuitive design and finance. 

At uni, I organize hackathons and try to learn a thing or two. Outside of uni, I run, read, and cook on Friday nights.

I write a [newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/veronicaseo/archive) sometimes.

Here is some [music](www.last.fm/user/veronicaseo) I like listening to.

Shoot me an email at veronica.seo @ gmail if you want to talk.
