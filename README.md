## Hi! Thanks for dropping by.

My name is **Veronica Seo**, and I am currently an [Industrial Engineering](https://ielm.ust.hk/eng/index.php) senior at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology due to graduate in December 2016.

At university, I've taken a wide range of courses, especially in finance and sociology in addition to in-major requisites. I also organize [Hackathon at HKUST](https://hack.ust.hk) and travel around the world to attend hacking seminars.

Most recently, I was in Detroit for MHacks 8, where my team won Best Use of BlackRock API for developing a [stock trading card game](https://devpost.com/software/cards-against-aladdin) serving as a gentle introduction to the world of personal finance.

Yeah, I like FinTech.

Currently, I'm on the lookout for corporate finance or systems engineering full time roles for a *January 2018 start* - particularly in venture capital, management consulting and product management. 

As of winter 2016-17, I'm slowly but surely getting on with data visualization, computer vision and machine learning as part of a Final Year Consulting project to build a custom optical character recognition software for use at a logistics warehouse. More details will be released as we make more and more progress.

*Freelancing* has been something I've dabbled in for some time: I typically write copy and translate documents in Chinese and Korean to English, and vice versa. I use [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~016051e2419194c433).

If you'd like to talk, shoot me an email at syseo (at) connect.ust.hk and I'll get back to you within a day. I'm almost always online.

Check out my summary at [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/veronicasyseo) if you'd like. Lastly, for now, this is a [link to my *resume*](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-Zp9ItZycBFZERUeWdma0lGVVE).

I'll leave you with a Spotify [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/22haigo43j4sbwo2nmwmjmbsi/playlist/3uipThQeqyF8GFycFKE5Xp), because I can't do without music.

Have a nice day!
