## Hi! Thanks for stopping by.

My name is **Veronica Seo**, and I am currently an [Industrial Engineering](https://ielm.ust.hk/eng/index.php) senior at *the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology* due to graduate in December 2016. Prior to relocating here for university, I read the International Baccalaureate and the IGCSE at the British International School Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City. Even before that, I was raised and educated in Hong Kong, Beijing and Seoul (in order of recency).


At university, I've taken a wide range of courses, especially in finance (declared a Business minor) and sociology (still debating whether or not to declare a Social Science minor) in addition to in-major requisites. I also organize [Hackathon at HKUST](https://hack.ust.hk) and travel around the world to attend hacking conferences. I love that I get to travel near and far to work with a different group of good friends each time, while hacking on a product that matters to all of us.


Most recently, I was in Detroit, Michigan, USA for *MHacks 8*, where my team won Best Use of BlackRock API for developing a [stock trading card game](https://devpost.com/software/cards-against-aladdin) serving as a gentle introduction to the world of personal finance.

#### **Currently, I'm on the lookout for corporate finance or systems engineering full time roles for a *January 2018 start* - particularly in venture capital, management consulting and product management. This is a link to my [*resume*](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-Zp9ItZycBFZERUeWdma0lGVVE) and my contact information.**

As of winter 2016-17, I'm slowly but surely getting on with data visualization, computer vision and machine learning as part of a Final Year Consulting project to build a custom optical character recognition software for use at a logistics warehouse. More details will be released as we make more and more progress. For now, I'll say that we're using a lot of Python, Java and Matlab, along with many daylight (and after dark) hours and manpower.


Outside of work and class, I'm a keen follower of tech investments and international finance - I really like *CB Insights*, *Mattermark* and *Finimize*. Subscribe to their newsletters and give them a read! I'm currently reading *Invisible Man* (recommend it thus far) and trying to get back into shape. A group of friends and I are planning a backpacking trip to Sichuan in the coming Spring. I also spend a lot of time on Facebook curating tech news content and writing posts in hacker groups hoping to catalyze a small fraction of the community around me to read, learn and act.


Writing is something I'm trying to pick up again. Every week (or every other week, or twice a week!) I'll send out a newsletter to a few close friends and others who are interested in reading curated tech, finance, social content from around the world. If you want to sign up, check out my [TinyLetter](http://tinyletter.com/veronicaseo/archive) page.


I'll leave you with a Spotify [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/22haigo43j4sbwo2nmwmjmbsi/playlist/3uipThQeqyF8GFycFKE5Xp), because I can't do without music. Electronic (I like [Nosaj Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNe3MvJzTyk)), garage rock (I love [The Strokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_l09H-3zzgA)) and folk (I don't have enough superlatives for [Elliott Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4cJv6s_Yjw)) are my preferred genres.
