## Hi! Thanks for dropping by.

My name is **Veronica Seo**, and I am currently an [Industrial Engineering](http://ielm.ust.hk/eng/index.php) senior at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology due to graduate in December 2016.

Currently, I'm on the lookout for corporate finance or systems engineering full time roles for a *January 2018 start* - particularly in venture capital, management consulting and product management.

Freelancing has been something I've dabbled in for some time: I typically write copy and translate documents in Chinese and Korean to English, and vice versa.

If you'd like to talk, shoot me an email at syseo (at) connect.ust.hk and I'll get back to you within a day. I'm almost always online.

Check out my summary at [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/veronicasyseo) if you'd like.

Have a nice day!
