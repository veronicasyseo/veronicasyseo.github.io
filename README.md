Hi! Thanks for dropping by.

My name is Veronica, and I am currently an Industrial Engineering senior at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in sunny Clear Water Bay.

Currently, I'm on the lookout for corporate finance or systems engineering full time roles for a January 2018 start - particularly in venture capital, management consulting and product management.

If you'd like to talk, shoot me an email at syseo (at) connect.ust.hk and I'll get back to you within a day. 

Check out my summary at LinkedIn if you'd like - you can find me again at "veronicasyseo".

Have a nice day!
